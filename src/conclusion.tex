In this paper, we propose an interruptible CNN accelerator and a deployment framework, INCAME, for multi-robot exploration. 
With the help of virtual-instruction-based interrupt method, the CNN accelerator can switch between different CNN tasks with low interrupt response latency and low extra cost. Therefore, the independent software in ROS can access the accelerator without hardware resources conflicts, so that the ROS-based MR-Exploration can achieve real-time performance on embedded FPGA. In the future, more robotic algorithms, such as DOpt, Exploration and Navigation, can be implemented on hardware and included in INCAME, to gain a better energy efficiency and achieve better real-time performance.
